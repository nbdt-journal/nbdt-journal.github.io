## NBDT Journal üëã

üìù [Neurons, Behavior, Data Analysis and Theory (NBDT)](https://nbdt.scholasticahq.com/about) publishes good computational neuroscience.
It is a community journal - its editorial board decides what is in scope. We are especially
interested in data, behavior, theory, analysis, modeling. This explicitly includes behavior-only
studies, software development, systems neuroscience, theory-only studies, and data-analysis studies.
All NBDT articles are peer reviewed.

üôã‚Äç This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to
the user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print,
search, or link to the full texts of the articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose,
without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the
BOAI definition of open access.

Authors need to choose CC-BY as license (also see [here](https://arxiv.org/help/license)) and should
indicate the license chosen in the manuscript. As NBDT is an arxiv overlay journal that choice is
needed in any case.

**NBDT is a true community journal, open in every way.**
Open science. Open data. And, we are openly asking for self-nominations for potential reviewers
